    "This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent\n",
    "on the CartPole-v1 task from [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or\n",
    "right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find more\n",

    "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses\n",

    "returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this\n",
    "task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment\n",
    "terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more than 2.4\n",
    "units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run\n",
    "for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real\n",
    "values representing the environment state [cart position, cart velocity, pole position, pole angular velocity].\n",
    "We take these 4 inputs without any scaling and pass them through a \n",
    "small fully-connected network with 2 outputs, one for each action. \n",

    "### TODO For Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this workshop is to expose you to the implementation of DQN and it can be used to solve a complex decision making problem such as CartPole. This is a self contained tutorial notebook which you can read and understand to gain a better intuition of the algorithm. I will encourage you to explore the impact of hyperparameters and the number of training steps on the performance of your system. Also you could also explore the concept of early-stopping where you kill the training process once you see it has reached a good performance and before it potentially gets worst (which can commonly occur in Reinforcement Learning). You will not have to implement this algorithm as that would be beyond the scope of this single lecture and tutorial of the subject, but use this as an insight into what is possible with RL and further your own learning on the topic.\n",
